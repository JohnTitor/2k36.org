## Highlighted works

- [https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/83654](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/83654)
- [https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup-components-history/](https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup-components-history/)
  - I made some minor improvements on the rustup components history.
    E.g., it now displays "Tier 2.5", previously it was "Tier25".
    Rust had so many tiers!
- Migrated from Travis CI to GHA on the rustc-dev-guide
  - [https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-dev-guide/pull/1073](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-dev-guide/pull/1073)
  - So, GHA is now one of my area :)

## Others / brief review

- March was an active month.
  - Comparing February, I made a lot of contributions in March since I got my passion and time back.
- I became a [library-reviewer on rust-lang/rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/governance/teams/library).
  - I'll help libc-related and some minor things.
    But I want to provide more help once I'm familiar with some area, of course.
- Also, I became a GNOME foundation member.
  - ...because I've helped Japanese translations since last Summer. i18n/l10n is my life.

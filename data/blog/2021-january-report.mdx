## Highlighted works

- Do not suggest invalid code in pattern with loop: <https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/80941>
  - Now rustc doesn't emit an invalid suggestions with moved value error on `loop` + `if let`.
- <https://os.phil-opp.com/ja/>
  - We've done translations for the "bare bones" part (I helped all the posts as a reviewer/co-translator).

## Others / brief review

- I spent some time for some interviews therefore I couldn't find much time for FLOSS :(
- I was taking a break as getting sick.
- So, the contribution count decreased, as expected.
  - It should be back in a few months, hopefully.

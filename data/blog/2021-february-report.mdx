## Highlighted works

- Reviewed 12 PRs in rust-lang/libc
  - Thanks all the contributors, libc v0.2.87 which includes them should be available now!
- [https://github.com/rust-lang/www.rust-lang.org/pull/1445](https://github.com/rust-lang/www.rust-lang.org/pull/1445)
  - Did you know that the governance page shew the 2019 roadmap until recently?
  - Please check Rust's 2021 roadmap if you haven't read it :) It mentions how we manage Rust teams in the future.

## Others / brief review

- Why does the contribution count keep decreasing?
  - I didn't think my physical condition or the time I spent FLOSS had changed much.
  - ...but I didn't make rollups much and it affected commit/PR count.
- Now my condition isn't bad and I may be able to find more time than February.

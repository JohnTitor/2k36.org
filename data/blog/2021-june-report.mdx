## Others / brief review

Some happy news from me!

### About my job

I'm now part of Huawei (since a few month ago) but nothing has changed, I'm working on rust-lang things as a work.
Thanks to them, I'm contributing to Rust-related stuff more actively!

### I'm now co-lead of the rustc-dev-guide working group

I've been contributing to the rustc-dev-guide since 2019 (it used to be called as "rustc-guide").
And now, I'm happy to announce that I'm new co-lead of the WG.
Huge thanks to [Joshua], the previous co-lead, they've made many contributions.

## Sponsors

I've been receiving a lot of support from my sponsors. Thank you so much!

I won't reveal the exact amount of money I've received since it's somewhat sensitive,
but it accounts for 20 to 30% of my income this year.
My sponsors literally make my life easier.

Here's my sponsors as of the writing this:

I'd especially like to express my tremendous gratitude to the long-time sponsors.
They make my life sustainable!

## Conclusion

I'm planning to continue my work contributing to FLOSS, in particular, the Rust community.

One thing I'd like to resolve in 2023 is to make two policies on the libc crate,
one is for minimum supported Rust version (MSRV) and the other is for minimum supported system library version.

The current MSRV of the crate is 1.13.0, which is quite old.
The libc crate currently supports newer Rust features using `cfg`s,
but it adds huge complexity to the codebase. It can be seen
in [this PR](https://github.com/rust-lang/libc/pull/2845)'s deletion diff.
[This issue](https://github.com/rust-lang/libs-team/issues/72) has a lot of discussion on this topic
but the decision hasn't been made yet.

And, we also don't have any policies for minimum supported system library version, e.g. glibc or musl.
This can be a problem when an upstream changes an ABI or removes an item.
If the libc crate followed that change immediately, it would break the existing code that depends on
old system library versions. There are some related discussion, e.g.
[#1412](https://github.com/rust-lang/libc/issues/1412) or [#1848](https://github.com/rust-lang/libc/issues/1848).

I'm sure making such policies will be difficult and controversial,
but I think it's necessary to make the crate more maintainable.

If you find my work useful, please consider sponsoring me. It definitely helps me and my life a lot.

## Sponsors

I've been receiving a lot of support from my sponsors. Thank you so much!

I won't reveal the exact amount of money I've received since it's somewhat sensitive,
but it accounts for 20 to 30% of my income this year.
My sponsors literally make my life easier.

Here's my sponsors as of the writing this:

I'd especially like to express my tremendous gratitude to the long-time sponsors.
They make my life sustainable!

## Conclusion

I'm planning to continue my work contributing to FLOSS, in particular, the Rust community.
If you find my work useful, please consider sponsoring me. It definitely helps me and my life a lot.

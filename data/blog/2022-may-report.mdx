## Others / brief review

### About my job

My contract with Huawei has ended.
That was wonderful time, I could contribute FLOSS without financial concern.
I now work for a Japanese company and am writing Go code.

If you has a job offer that I can communicate with Japanese, feel free to email me :)

### FLOSS work

I've:

- become a LLVM committer, contributed to some test and doc fixes
- become a Kubernetes organization member, cotributed to test-infra, krew, docs, and some more things
- become an Invited Expert of W3C i18n WG, will contribute to i18n-related stuff

In this year, I want to try to start new things other than Rust.
Rust is my comfort zone and I'd like to go to outside of it.
